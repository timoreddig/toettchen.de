SallyCMS
========

SallyCMS is a flexible and fast PHP 5.2+ CMS, aimed at professional developers.
It integrates well with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) and a good balance
between enterprise frameworks like [Symfony2](http://symfony.com/) (from which
it thankfully adopts some ideas and concepts) and simpler systems like
[REDAXO](http://www.redaxo.org/) (which is where Sally originally forked from
in 2009).

SallyCMS can be used to develop small one-pagers, complex websites or
webservices. The frontend (if any) is completely up to the developer, whereas
the backend is standardized and can easily extended and customized.

The development is fast paced and aims to release roughly two "main" releases
per year. Because the API and some concepts are not considered stable and can
change heavily between "main" releases, we release major versions as 0.x minor
releases (until we're sure we can support the API for a longer time, at which
we will switch to the regular [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/) scheme).
Bugfix releases occur roughly every month and do not change the API in
incompatible ways (so it's safe and recommended to update projects frequently).

Requirements
------------

SallyCMS requires PHP 5.2.3+. Note that for using Composer, your system needs
to have at least PHP 5.3, but the actual SallyCMS code and (most) addOns ar
compatible with PHP 5.2. So you can safely deploy a project to a 5.2 hosting.

On top of that, SallyCMS required MySQL 5.0+ and Apache 2.2+. It's compatible
with PHP up to 5.5, MySQL 5.6 (and MariaDB 5.5) and Apache 2.4.

To install non-stable addOns or SallyCMS versions, you will also need Mercurial
and Git installed on your system (but again, not on the hosting side).

Installation / Usage
--------------------

You can either use Composer to install SallyCMS (using the standard
distribution) or download a prebuilt
[starterkit](https://bitbucket.org/SallyCMS/sallycms/downloads). But be aware
that sooner or later you will need to use Composer (for example to install
addOns or update SallyCMS), so we strongly recommended starting with the
standard distribution.

1. [Install Composer](http://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md).
2. [Download](https://bitbucket.org/SallyCMS/sallycms/downloads) the standard or
   starterkit distribution. Extract it to your desired location, most likely
   somewhere in your webserver's document root.
3. (Only if using the standard distribution) Install the dependencies using
   Composer: `php composer.phar install`
4. Open the project in your browser: `http://localhost/path/to/sallycms/` You
   will automatically be redirected to the setup application. Finish it to
   start using the backend.
5. Install your required addOns by adding them to the `composer.json`.
